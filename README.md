# Android Against Humanity

An Android sample application using API 21. Hooked up with [this server](https://github.com/acadet/socket-against-humanity).

<s>Available on the Play Store</s>. The app was rejected due to the conflict with the Android brand. Will be fixed soon. Feel free to download the app [from Github](https://github.com/acadet/android-against-humanity/releases).
